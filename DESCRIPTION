Description: A C++ implementation of Huber mean estimation, Huber regression and l1-regularized Huber regression (Huber-Lasso).
             Among all the methods, the robustification parameter tau is chosen by a tuning-free principle.
             In low dimensions, Huber regression estimators are calculated via gradient descent, and Huber-Lasso estimators are computed by the I-LAMM algorithm.
